For the further growth of the IC network, the NNS agreed on a new replica hardware specification. The new specification is generic, i.e. not vendor specific. It is ready for upcoming ICP improvements. For example, it supports VM memory encryption and attestation which will further increase the security of dapps running on ICP. The new specification results in different captical expenses for the independent node providers running replica nodes. Consequently, a new NP reward structure (remuneration) is required. Based on feedback and discussion within the community, this remuneration is based on:
- Higher rewards for the first nodes of a new NP in order to attract more NPs in an effort to improve ownership decentralization.
- More refined rewards for nodes in new geographies, like South America, Africa, Asia and Australia, to stimulate further geographical decentralization.
